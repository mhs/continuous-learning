# Binary Chop Kata

This kata is based on the [Binary Chop Kata](http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/kata_two_karate.html) that Dave Thomas posted a few years back.

## Overview

From Dave's original post:

> Write a binary chop method that takes an integer search target
> and a sorted array of integers. It should return the integer
> index of the target in the array, or -1 if the target is not in
> the array. The signature will logically be:
>  
>      chop(int, array_of_int)  -> int
>  
>  You can assume that the array has less than 100,000 elements. For
>  the purposes of this Kata, time and memory performance are not issues
>  (assuming the chop terminates before you get bored and kill it, and
>  that you have enough RAM to run it).

### Instructions

* Provide two implementations (an iterative and a recursive) to satisfy to satisfy the examples in *spec/binary\_chopper\_spec.rb*
