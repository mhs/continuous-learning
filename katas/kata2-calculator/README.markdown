# Describing a Calculator

Having the ability to describe how an object behaves without access to its implementation forces us to think about the behavior we want under a new set of constraints.

Practicing this skill can grow our ability to think through and articulate where we're taking the code before we attempt to take it there. This pushes us to design code that lends itself to clarity, flexibility, and having a respectable separation between interface and implementation.

Another way to think about describing our code with how we want it to work is that we are forced to think about the design of our code as it pertains to testability.

Considering code and its behavior from different angles helps us consider new ways of approaching and solving problems with it.

## Overview

Write a spec describing the expected behavior of a calculator.

It can be assumed that the numbers themselves will be inputs to the calculator and that the calculator is already "on".

### Instructions

* Write a spec describing the expected behaviors of a calculator object.

* Implement your spec and keep track of whenever you have to modify your spec for whatever reason.

* Give your spec to someone else to implement and ask them to keep track of whenever they have to modify your spec.

* When you and the implementor are done compare notes. What kinds of things needed to be changed and why?

### Variations

* Choose a different calculator to spec
* Use a different host language and/or testing framework
